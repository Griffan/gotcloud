{"name":"Gotcloud","tagline":"Genomes on the Cloud, Mapping & Variant Calling Pipelines","body":"### Welcome to GotCloud.\r\nGenomes on the Cloud (GotCloud) is our set of sequence analysis software pipelines that we developed to handle the increasing volume of next generation sequencing and genotyping data.\r\n* Integrative - Alignment, QC, Variant Calling, Phasing\r\n* Seamless - Requires only simple configuration files\r\n * Fully automated and parallelized\r\n* Robust against unexpected failures & stops\r\n* Scalable from a few to many thousands of genomes\r\n * Deep Genomes, Shallow Genomes, Targeted Exomes\r\n\r\nAlso included within GotCloud\r\n* Set of many useful software tools\r\n* Software C++ library for developing additional sequence analysis tools\r\n\r\nSee (http://gotcloud.org) for full GotCloud documentation.\r\n\r\n### Obtain GotCloud\r\nFirst download GotCloud either using git or by using one of the download buttons to the left. \r\nSee (http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/GotCloud:_Source_Releases) for more information\r\n\r\n### Build GotCloud\r\nBefore running GotCloud, you need to compile the source:\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_downloaded_gotcloud_dir/src; make; cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test GotCloud\r\nTo test GotCloud align, run:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gotcloud align --test ~/testalign\r\n```\r\nThis will create/clear the output directory ~/testalign (alternatively, you can choose a different directory).\r\nTest results and a log file are put into that directory.\r\nResults are self-checked, and if any errors should occur, GotCloud will print an error message.\r\n\r\nTo test  GotCloud snpcall, run:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gotcloud snpcall --test ~/testsnp\r\n```\r\nThis will create/clear the output directory ~/testsnp (alternatively, you can choose a different directory).\r\nTest results and a log file are put into that directory.\r\nResults are self-checked, and if any errors should occur, GotCloud will print an error message.\r\n\r\nTo test  GotCloud ldrefine, run:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gotcloud ldrefine --test ~/testsnp\r\n```\r\nThe ldrefine test can only be run after the snpcall test, and must use the same directory used for the snpcall test.\r\nTest results and a log file are put into that directory.\r\nResults are self-checked, and if any errors should occur, GotCloud will print an error message.\r\n\r\nTo test  GotCloud indel, run:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gotcloud indel --test ~/testindel\r\n```\r\nThis will create/clear the output directory ~/testindel (alternatively, you can choose a different directory).\r\nTest results and a log file are put into that directory.\r\nResults are self-checked, and if any errors should occur, GotCloud will print an error message.\r\n\r\n### General Help for Variant Calling\r\nVariant Calling requires three types of input files:\r\n  (1) a set of BAM files\r\n      For high quality SNP calls BAM files should already be:\r\n      * duplicate-marked \r\n      * base-quality recalibrated\r\n  (2) index file\r\n      Each line contains at least 3 space-separated columns representing a single individual:\r\n      [SAMPLE_ID] [COMMA SEPARATED POPULATION LABELS] [BAM_FILE1] [BAM_FILE2] ...\r\n      1 or more BAMs are allowed per individual\r\n  (3) configuration file\r\n      Contains run-time options & command line arguments.  \r\n      A default configuration is provided.\r\n      User must specify:\r\n      * BAM_INDEX =   # the path/name of the index file\r\n      * OUT_DIR\r\n\r\n      Optional specifications...\r\n      * CHRS = #space separated list of chromosomes - defaults to 1-22 & X\r\n\r\n      Refer to the default configuration & the wiki page for more information on other settings.\r\n         * http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/GotCloud:_Variant_Calling_Pipeline#Configuration_File\r\n\r\nOptional input files:\r\n   * Pedigree files (PED format) (to specify gender information in chrX calling)\r\n   * Target information (UCSC's BED format) in targeted or whole exome capture sequencing\r\n\r\nOnce these files are configured, to run snp calling and process the data:\r\n   {path}gotcloud snpcall --conf {conf_file} \\\r\n      --outdir {output_directory} --numjobs {# of threads to use for processing}\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGotCloud has been developed and maintained by within the Center of Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan.
